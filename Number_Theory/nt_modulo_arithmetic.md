given two positive integers `a` and `b` 
$$ a = b*q+r\hspace{5mm}\{0<=r<b,\text{ }q>=0\}$$
And this above is called the Euclid's division lemma. And here, 
$$ r= a\%b$$
if `r == 0`, this means a is divisible by b and it is written as
$$a|b$$
Notation:
$$a \equiv b \mod{n} $$
this means
$$a\%n = b\%n$$

Now let's take a dive into the world of modulo n.

now as we go above `n-1`, like n, n+1 etc we'll just loop back to 0, 1, 2 and
