These operators are used to compare to values. And these are the comparative operators we have:
1. **\=\=** : Equals
2. **!\=** : Not Equals
3. **<** : Less Than
4. **<=** : Less Than Or Equal To
5. **>** : Greater Than
6. **>=** : Greater Than Or Equal To

> Note: A new comparison operator is now added in `C++` starting from the `C++20` standard called the three way comparison operator written as `<=>`. Usage is as follows

```c++
a<=>b
/*
is negative when a is less than b
is zero when a is equal to b
is positive when a is greater than b
*/
```

## Examples
```c
int a=5, b=3, c=5, d=7;

a==c   // true
a!=b   // true
a>b    // true
a>=c   // true
a<d    // true
b<=c   // true  
```
