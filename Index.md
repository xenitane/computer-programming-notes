> These are my notes for computer programming and competitive coding. We'll start from basics in `C-Language` and then further dive into the crazy world of mathematics, data structures, algorithms and a lot more stuff which might sound boring at first, but is the essential juice needed for to solve problems cause let's be honest, what are computers but just large and fancy calculators. And once you start developing skills in reading \& understanding of code and further logic building, combining different methods to solve problems and a lot more. Then this will further help you in honing your skills and techniques to write clean and efficient code even when working with large systems having millions of lines of code.

> Therefore, we can say that programming is writing a sequence of instructions which the computer will take and do computations to reach from the input to the desired output.
> While programming, we'll face several problems where the code we've written might not work correctly, and that's alright, these mistakes will show us what we are doing incorrect while writing the instruction sequence, and we'll work on them to reach the desired solution.
