Suppose we have two number `a` and `b`, such that $a+b=0$. Then it is said that `a` and `b` are additive inverses of each other.

And for modulo `n` only whole number less than n are allowed, and the concept of additive inverses turn into
$$
\begin{align} \\
&\{a,b\in\mathbb{Z}\}\\
a+b&\equiv0&\mod{n}\\
\implies b&\equiv0-a&\mod{n} \\
\implies b&\equiv-a&\mod{n} \\
\implies b&=k*n-a&\{k\in\mathbb{Z}\}
\end{align}
$$
and from this we have obtained the general expression for the additive inverse of `a`.
