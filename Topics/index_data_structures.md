Data Structures are our custom made data types and to be able to use those types again, we need to declare them using a special keyword, and for that we use some special keywords we'll encounter as we go.

But before we go any further there is a keyword we need to know about, `typedef`. This keyword is used to create aliases for some existing things. And it's syntax is pretty easy too.

```c
typedef old_name new_name;

// example

typedef long long int lli;
```

> Note: it can also be used on anonymous types we'll see later.


- [Array](../Data_Structures/ds_array.md)
- [`struct`](../Data_Structures/ds_struct.md)
- [`enum`](../Data_Structures/ds_enum.md)
- [`union`](../Data_Structures/ds_union.md)

> Now that we've seen structs, enums, and unions, we can use them in a nested fashion too in ways we see fit to satisfy our requirements.
