The fundamental piece for electronic computers is bits, and a collection of bits is used to represent numbers (integers, floating point numbers), characters and boolean values, addresses of these variables etc.

And that's not it, there are a lot more types we can create using collection of the types we mentioned above and the types we created earlier. And these collections are called [data structures](index_data_structures.md). And we'll study them later in detail.
