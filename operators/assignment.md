These operators are used to assign a value to the reference given by the left operand and these are as follows:

1. **\=** : copies the value of the right operand into the reference of the left operand
2. **+\=** : copies the sum of values of both operands into the reference of the left operand
3. **-\=** : copies the value obtained by subtracting the right operand from the left one into the reference of the left operand
4. **\*\=** : copies the product of both operand into the reference of the left operand
5. **\\\=** : copies the value obtained by dividing the left operand by the right one into the reference of the left operand
6. **%\=** : copies the value of the remainder obtained by dividing the left operand by the right one into the reference of the left operand
7. **&\=** : copies the binary and of both operand into the reference of the left operand
8. **|\=** : copies the binary or of both operand into the reference of the left operand
9. **^\=** : copies the binary xor of both operand into the reference of the left operand
10. **<<\=** : copies the value obtained by shifting the value left operand to the left by the value of right operand into the reference of the left operand
11. **>>\=** : copies the value obtained by shifting the value left operand to the right by the value of right operand into the reference of the left operand

> And another way of understanding the mix assignment operators in as follows:
> **x (op)= y --> x = (x) (op) (y)**
