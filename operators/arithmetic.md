These operators are used to do basic Arithmetic Operations on the data we are presented with.

These are the Arithmetic operators available to us
1. **+** : plus - add two operands present on it's left and right
2. **-** : minus - subtract the right operand from the left one
3. **\*** : asterisk - multiply the operands present on it's left and right
4. **\/** : slash - divides the left operand by the one on the right, and for integers, just gives out the quotient
5. **%** : modulo - only works with integral types and produces the remainder left when the left operand is divided by the right operand
6. \( or \) : parenthesis - are used to enclose and expression or value

## Examples
```c
int a=10, b=3;

a+b          // 13
a-b          // 7
a*b          // 30
a/b          // 3
a%b          // 1
(a+b)/(b*b)  // 1

float x=2.5, y=4.0;

x/y          // 0.625
```
