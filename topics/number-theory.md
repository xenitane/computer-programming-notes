Now that we have gathered the tool of programming, let's dive into the essentials, aka Math and we'll start the journey from studying number theory.

Computers, these fancy calculators, have to deal with a lot of numbers, so need to dive into the world of numbers, As mentioned before in _data types and variables[^1]_ there are various sets of numbers. But all of them don't concern us, we just need to consider a handful of them for now. Now let's look at some essential topics concerning integers.
