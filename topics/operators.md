As we said earlier that computers are just big and fancy calculators, and now that we have defined how we store numbers and information, we want to be able to some work on it. And to do anything task over something is called an operation, and we have different kind of operations and as they are all different, they need to have different identification and we do that by assigning a special symbol to them and that's called an operator.

And operators can work on operands that are available in the scope where the operation is being executed.
