When writing code we have a set of instructions right, and the sequence in which they are carried out is vital to our task. The computer executes one instruction at a time, and the way it proceeds from 1 instruction to other is called the flow of program. So we need a mechanism to control that flow and for that we have the below mentioned methods:

`class:multi-col-list`

- [[../control-flow/conditionality.md|if/else]]
- [[../control-flow/loops.md|for/while/do]]
- [[../control-flow/br-ct.md|break/continue]]
- [[../control-flow/switch-case.md|switch/case]]
- [[../control-flow/label-goto.md|labels/goto]]
- [[../control-flow/functions.md|functions/return]]
